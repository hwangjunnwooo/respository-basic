## P3.1 A spring-mass-damper system is shown in Figure P3.1. (a) Identify a suitable set of state variables. (b) Obtain the set of first-order differential equations in terms of the state variables. (c) Write the state differential equation.

먼저 state variables를 정의하면 변위를 $y(t)=x_1(t)$ 속도를 $y'(t)=x_2(t)$라 정의한다.
